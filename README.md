# AstraOS
This is a 64 bit OS I am working on. Currently I am working on cleaning up code and getting a 64 bit kernel up and running. Under the Legacy folder you can see my old code which was working but it was initally made for 32 bit and I later changed it to 64 bit which caused some issues. I decided to start from scratch and rewrite it for 64 bit from the ground up.
